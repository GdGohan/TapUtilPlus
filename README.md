# TapUtilPlus

[Releases](https://github.com/GdGohan/TapUtilPlus/releases)

Cryptography 

Read files from an external storage directory 

Use any audio size and duration in sound effects
 
Music room implemented 

Option to send a message via Bluetooth before starting the multiplayer battle 

Music selection menu 

Scenario selection menu 

Temporarily pause scene music when using a specific sound effect

Load video when playing a specific SE/BGM

Usage:

Use the new gamedata, it extends the amount of snd for battle mode, you can change the ids and consequently add more songs than the game's default amount, search for "SND" in the 001.dac file.

The new apk will use a larger amount, so you will not be able to decrease the amount of "SND", but you will be able to repeat the ids of the songs

The extra files that will be in the game folder will not need to be compiled, just change them and save the changes.

SE_MP: number

File name: se_+number (for longer and heavier audios)

PAUSE: 
0 - does not pause the game and block the touch, 

1 - pause the game and block the touch, 

2 - does not pause the game and does not block the touch, 

3 - pause the game and does not block the touch.

The music room images can be edited by any tool that edits an apk 

and is capable of exchanging images from the res folder

## General Overview
The `TCBManajer` class is the core of the engine. It coordinates:

- Loading of characters, cards, HUDs, etc.
- State and transition management
- Reading and writing `.pac`, `.bin`, `.dac` files
- Input and touch system
- Script execution (e.g., `Run()`)

---

## Game States
Controlled by:
- `tcbNow.md` (current mode)
- `tcbNow.lp` (time in mode)

---

## System States (`tcbNow.md`)

`tcbNow.md` represents the current "mode" or phase of real-time execution. It changes frame by frame as the game progresses.
